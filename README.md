# workshop-spec-kit
Code and sample app for my workshop about SDD with Spec Kit

## Prerequisites
- IDE of your choice
- AI Agent of your choice (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.). This workshop uses IntelliJ IDEA with GitHub Copilot.

## Code in this project
The code in this project was generated using Spec Kit and GitHub Copilot. It follows the Tutorial vides availeble at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9eR1xsfvHg.

For each step of the Spec Kit SDLC a separate commit was made so you can follow along and see how the code evolved during the process.

## Getting Started for your own project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Visit the [Spec Kit Repository](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) and follow the instructions to install the Specify CLI (optional but recommended). Alternatively, you can download the Spec Kit templates for a combination of AI Agent and CLI language as a Zip file and extract it to your local machine.

## Prompt/command log
The following prompts and/or commands were used to generate the code in this repository using GitHub Copilot.

### Step 0: Initialize project using Specify
Specify is a CLI tool that basically does nothing but provide a nice console dialog to download the right templates for your combination of AI Agent and programming language and makes them executable. I used the persistent installation and initialized this repository using the following command:

```shell
specify init --here --ai copilot --script sh
```

This creates the following folders and files:
```text
./
├─ .github/                 # Directory containing GitHub Copilot specific configuration files (this directory will be named differently for other AI Agents)
│  ├─ agents/               # AI agent instructions for each step of the Spec Kit SDLC on how to handle the user input
│  ├─ prompts/              # Prompts for each step of the Spec Kit SDLC. The files are needed so the AI Agent can reference them during generation.
├─ .specify/                # Directory containing Specify related configuration files
│  ├─ memory/               # Memory files for each step of the Spec Kit SDLC to help the AI Agent remember previous steps
│  │  ├─ constitution.md    # Spec Kit a blank template for a constitution file defining the principles and guidelines for the AI Agent during the SDLC
│  ├─ scripts/              # Directory containing shell scripts to automate the Spec Kit SDLC steps
│  │  ├─ bash/              # Bash scripts for each step of the Spec Kit SDLC
│  ├─ templates/            # Directory containing templates for each step of the Spec Kit SDLC
```

### Step 1: Define Constitution
I used the following prompt to generate the constitution for this project:

```
/speckit.constitution Fill the constitution with the bare minimum requirements for a static web app based on the template
```

This prompte did the following:
- Filled the blank constitution template file at `./specify/memory/constitution.md` with meaningful content for a static web app project
- Changed `./speecify/templates/plan-template.md` to reference the constitution check


### Step 2: Specify

I used the following prompt to generate the specification for this project:

```shell
/speckit.specify I am building a modern website. I want it ot look sleek, something that would stand out. Should have a landing page with one featured episode. There should be an episodes page, an about page, and a FAQ page. Should have 20 episodes, and the data is mocked - you do not ened to pull anything from any real feed.
```

This command did the following:
- checked out a new branch `001-episodes-showcase`. All subsequent commands and files were executed/created on this branch.
- created the specification file at `./specs/001-episodes-showcase/spec.md` with the content generated by the AI Agent based on the prompt above. This file contains:
  - User Scenarios with Acceptance Criteria
  - Edge Cases to consider
  - Functional Requirements that are testable
  - Non-Functional Requirements
  - Key Entities to be used
  - Success Criteria for when the feature is considered done
  - UX/UI notes with design considerations
  - and many more
- created the file `./site/data/episodes.json` with mocked episode data as per the specification.

Note how there are no technical details in the specification. This is not in scope with the absraction level of the specification. Technical details will be added in the next step during the planning phase.

Note: Funnily this prompt already created a file `./site/tasks.md` with a task list. This is not intended behavior of the `/speckit.specify` command but rather a side-effect of the AI Agent trying to be helpful. The correct place for the task list is in the next step during the task breakdown phase. I deleted the file for now to keep things clean.
