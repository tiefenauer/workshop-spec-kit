# workshop-spec-kit
Code and sample app for my workshop about SDD with Spec Kit

## Prerequisites
- IDE of your choice
- AI Agent of your choice (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.). This workshop uses IntelliJ IDEA with GitHub Copilot.

## Code in this project
The code in this project was generated using Spec Kit and GitHub Copilot. It follows the Tutorial vides availeble at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9eR1xsfvHg.

For each step of the Spec Kit SDLC a separate commit was made so you can follow along and see how the code evolved during the process.

## Getting Started for your own project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Visit the [Spec Kit Repository](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) and follow the instructions to install the Specify CLI (optional but recommended). Alternatively, you can download the Spec Kit templates for a combination of AI Agent and CLI language as a Zip file and extract it to your local machine.

## Prompt/command log
The following prompts and/or commands were used to generate the code in this repository using GitHub Copilot.

### Step 0: Initialize project using Specify
Specify is a CLI tool that basically does nothing but provide a nice console dialog to download the right templates for your combination of AI Agent and programming language and makes them executable. I used the persistent installation and initialized this repository using the following command:

```shell
specify init --here --ai copilot --script sh
```

This creates the following folders and files:
```text
./
├─ .github/                 # Directory containing GitHub Copilot specific configuration files (this directory will be named differently for other AI Agents)
│  ├─ agents/               # AI agent instructions for each step of the Spec Kit SDLC on how to handle the user input
│  ├─ prompts/              # Prompts for each step of the Spec Kit SDLC. The files are needed so the AI Agent can reference them during generation.
├─ .specify/                # Directory containing Specify related configuration files
│  ├─ memory/               # Memory files for each step of the Spec Kit SDLC to help the AI Agent remember previous steps
│  │  ├─ constitution.md    # Spec Kit a blank template for a constitution file defining the principles and guidelines for the AI Agent during the SDLC
│  ├─ scripts/              # Directory containing shell scripts to automate the Spec Kit SDLC steps
│  │  ├─ bash/              # Bash scripts for each step of the Spec Kit SDLC
│  ├─ templates/            # Directory containing templates for each step of the Spec Kit SDLC
```

### Step 1: Define Constitution
I used the following prompt to generate the constitution for this project:

```
/speckit.constitution Fill the constitution with the bare minimum requirements for a static web app based on the template
```

This prompte did the following:
- Filled the blank constitution template file at `./specify/memory/constitution.md` with meaningful content for a static web app project
- Changed `./speecify/templates/plan-template.md` to reference the constitution check


### Step 2: Specify

I used the following prompt to generate the specification for this project:

```shell
/speckit.specify I am building a modern website. I want it ot look sleek, something that would stand out. Should have a landing page with one featured episode. There should be an episodes page, an about page, and a FAQ page. Should have 20 episodes, and the data is mocked - you do not ened to pull anything from any real feed.
```

This command did the following:
- checked out a new branch `001-episodes-showcase`. All subsequent commands and files were executed/created on this branch.
- created the specification file at `./specs/001-episodes-showcase/spec.md` with the content generated by the AI Agent based on the prompt above. This file contains:
  - User Scenarios with Acceptance Criteria
  - Edge Cases to consider
  - Functional Requirements that are testable
  - Non-Functional Requirements
  - Key Entities to be used
  - Success Criteria for when the feature is considered done
  - UX/UI notes with design considerations
  - and many more
- created the file `./site/data/episodes.json` with mocked episode data as per the specification.

Note how there are no technical details in the specification. This is not in scope with the absraction level of the specification. Technical details will be added in the next step during the planning phase.

Note: Funnily this prompt already created a file `./site/tasks.md` with a task list. This is not intended behavior of the `/speckit.specify` command but rather a side-effect of the AI Agent trying to be helpful. The correct place for the task list is in the next step during the task breakdown phase. I deleted the file for now to keep things clean.

### Step 3: Plan

I used the following prompt to generate the implementation plan for this project:

```shell
/speckit.plan I am going to use Next.js with static site configuration, no databases - data is embedded in the content for the mock episodes. Site is reponsive and ready for mobile.
```

This prompt did the following:
- created the plan file at `./specs/001-episodes-showcase/plan.md based on the template at .specify/templates/plan-template.md
- filled in the Technical Context section with relevant technical details based on the prompt
- Performed a constitution check and added a PASS checklist to the Constitution Check section
- created the schema for the episode data model at `./specs/001-episodes-showcase/episode.schema.md` based on the episode data in `./site/data/episodes.json`

Note: like in the previous step the AI Agent created a task list in the plan file. This is not intended behavior of the `/speckit.plan` command but rather a side-effect of the AI Agent trying to be helpful.  I deleted the task list from the plan file to keep things clean.

### Step 4: Task Breakdown
I used the following prompt to generate the task breakdown for this project:

```shell
/speckit.tasks break this down into tasks
```

This prompt did the following:
- created the task list file at `./specs/001-episodes-showcase/tasks.md based on the tasks identified by the AI Agent from the specification and plan files. The file is based on the template at .specify/templates/tasks-template.md. Each task contains:
  - A unique identifier
  - A short title
  - A description
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Estimated effort in story points
- Tasks are grouped into logical phases:
- Phase 1: Setup Project Structure
- Phase 2: Implement Core Features
- Phase 3ff: User Stories from the specification


### Step 5: Implementation

I used the following prompt to implement the feature based on the tasks identified in the previous step (Note: I used Claude Haiku 4.5 for this step just to try out a different model):

```shell
/speckit.implement implement the tasks for this project and update the task list as you go
```

This prompt did the following:
- implemented the feature as a Next.js application based on the specification, plan, and task list
  - some generated files contained errors or were incomplete. The Agent was able to detect this and re-generate or fix the files as needed.
- Generated all files needed for the application including:
  - pages
  - components
  - styles
  - data loading logic
  - audio player logic
  - SEO optimizations
  - tests
- Updated the task list file at `./specs/001-episodes-showcase/tasks.md` to reflect the progress made on each task. Completed tasks are marked as done.
- Ran tests and ensured all tests pass
- Ran the build process and ensured the build completes successfully
- Generated a bunch of markdown files with instructions on how to run and use the application
  - `./00_START_HERE.md`: Quick start guide for the application
  - `./BUILD_VERIFICATION.md`: Instructions on how to verify the build
  - `./DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`: Index of all documentation files generated for the application
  - `./FINAL_REPORT.md`: Final report summarizing the implementation process and outcomes
  - `./IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`: Confirmation that the implementation is complete
  - `./PROJECT_COMLETE.md`: Confirmation that the project is complete
  - `./STATUS.md`: Status report of the implementation process
  - `./TASK_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md`: Checklist of completed tasks
- updated this file (`./README.md`) to include an overview of the project and instructions on how to get started
